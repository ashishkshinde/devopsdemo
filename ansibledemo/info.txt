Ansible is a python product, we can use python package manager pip to install it.
To install Ansible on RHEL Host :
    sudo pip3.11 install ansible

To test the connectivity between master and slave device :
    ansible -i <host-ip> -e ansible_user=<user_name> ansible_password=<pwd> -m ping

Below command is used to manage config of a specific host (multiple hosts can be seperated by comma):
    ansible-playbook -i <host-ip> -e ansible_user=<user_name> ansible_password=<pwd> <playbook file>

Common hosts can be managed using inventory file. Inventory file can be used to store the endpoint addresses as well as the UID & PWDs.
This file needs to save only with the extension as .txt or .ine for ansible to recognize them.
Command to manage config of multiple hosts using ansible playbook is :
    ansible -i <inventory file> all <playbook file>
